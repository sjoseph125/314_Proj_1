This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook to use as a template for your Unit Project 1.

Add new chunks by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it. YOU DO NOT NEED TO KNIT. Instead, click Preview. The HTML file that is rendered will automatically be saved.

You will submit both the saved R Markdown file (.RMD) WITH A NEW NAME and the HTML file.

## Background
[Remove this text and replace with:  Provide a brief (one paragraph, please!) background description of 1) your task and 2) the context of your analysis. The context of your analysis should include: origin of dataset (if applicable), population of interest, data collection method, size of the data set, and a table of variables/factors to be explored with an explanation of what they mean and what type of variables they are.]

## Data Analyses

### Analysis 1: One Quantitative Variable
#### Analyst:Sean Simmons

[Put text of analysis here and add as many code chunks and text sections as you need.]

```{r}
summary(vgs$NA_Sales, na.rm = TRUE) # summarize the variable NA_Sales
sd(vgs$NA_Sales, na.rm = TRUE) # find the standard deviation
IQR(vgs$NA_Sales, na.rm = TRUE) # find the IQR
nasmildthreshold = (.28*1.5) + .28 # mild threshold
nasmaxthreshold = (.28*3) + .28 # extreme threshold
ggplot(data = vgs, aes(y = NA_Sales)) + geom_boxplot() + coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 1.12))
```



### Analysis 2: One Categorical Variable
#### Analyst:[Name of Team Member]

[Put text of analysis here and add as many code chunks and text sections as you need.]


```{r}

```




### Analysis 3: Two Categorical Variables Joey
#### Analyst:[Name of Team Member]

[Put text of analysis here and add as many code chunks and text sections as you need.]

ggplot(vgs, aes(Critic_Score, NA_Sales)) + geom_point() +ylab('NA Sales') + xlab('Critic Score') + ylim(0, 20)
```





## Recommendations

[Add text section with your recommendations here. In this section, you will briefly summarize the most interesting features of your data. Are you seeing any trends, associations, or interesting features? Highlight these and make a recommendation that they be subjected to further statistical analysis. If there isnâ€™t anything interesting, say so!]
