This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook to use as a template for your Unit Project 1.

Add new chunks by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it. YOU DO NOT NEED TO KNIT. Instead, click Preview. The HTML file that is rendered will automatically be saved.

You will submit both the saved R Markdown file (.RMD) WITH A NEW NAME and the HTML file.

## Background
[Remove this text and replace with:  Provide a brief (one paragraph, please!) background description of 1) your task and 2) the context of your analysis. The context of your analysis should include: origin of dataset (if applicable), population of interest, data collection method, size of the data set, and a table of variables/factors to be explored with an explanation of what they mean and what type of variables they are.]

## Data Analyses

### Analysis 1: One Quantitative Variable
#### Analyst:Sean Simmons

[Put text of analysis here and add as many code chunks and text sections as you need.]

```{r}
summary(vgs$NA_Sales, na.rm = TRUE) # summarize the variable NA_Sales
sd(vgs$NA_Sales, na.rm = TRUE) # find the standard deviation
IQR(vgs$NA_Sales, na.rm = TRUE) # find the IQR
```



### Analysis 2: One Categorical Variable
#### Analyst:[Name of Team Member]

[Put text of analysis here and add as many code chunks and text sections as you need.]


```{r}

```




### Analysis 3: Two Categorical Variables Joey
#### Analyst:[Name of Team Member]

[Put text of analysis here and add as many code chunks and text sections as you need.]

```{r}

```




### Analysis 4: One Categorical and One Quantitative Variable
#### Analyst:[Name of Team Member]

[Put text of analysis here and add as many code chunks and text sections as you need.]

```{r}

```




### Analysis 5: Two Quantitative Variable
#### Analyst:Samson Joseph

For this analysis the variables Critic_Score and NA_Sales were chosen. The explanatory variable would be Critic_Score and the response variable would be NA_Sales.As depicted by the graph below, there is a positive association between the two variables. As Critic_Score goes higher, so does NA_Sales. This makes sense as the more positive reviews from critics, the more the game will sell. Critic scores and reviews gives insight to how potential users might experience the game. They influence potential users, and that is clear based on the graph below. An outlier that was removed was Wii Sports. It is difficult to say if it's sales was related to critic score based on the data we have. It was sold with the Wii console, so it's sales numbers are not necessarily influenced by critics.

```{r warning= FALSE}
ggplot(vgs, aes(Critic_Score, NA_Sales)) + geom_point() +ylab('NA Sales') + xlab('Critic Score') + ylim(0, 20)

```





## Recommendations

[Add text section with your recommendations here. In this section, you will briefly summarize the most interesting features of your data. Are you seeing any trends, associations, or interesting features? Highlight these and make a recommendation that they be subjected to further statistical analysis. If there isnâ€™t anything interesting, say so!]
