## Data Analyses

### Analysis 1: One Quantitative Variable
#### Analyst:Sean Simmons

Based on the summary statistics for the NA_Sales, I find the median to be the more accurate measure of center as there are outliers that skew the data to the right. To supplement the 5 number summary, I've identified a mild threshold at 1.5 times the IQR added to the 3rd quartile, and an extreme threshold at 3 times the IQR added to the 3rd quartile. There are 774 observations above the established extreme threshold, which I consider to be outliers. To better visualize the data, I have limited the y-value to not exceed the extreme threshold. 4511 observations where the NA_Sales data is missing have been removed.

```{r}
summary(vgs$NA_Sales, na.rm = TRUE) # summarize the variable NA_Sales
sd(vgs$NA_Sales, na.rm = TRUE) # find the standard deviation
IQR(vgs$NA_Sales, na.rm = TRUE) # find the IQR
nasmildthreshold = (.28*1.5) + .28 # mild threshold
print(nasmildthreshold)
nasmaxthreshold = (.28*3) + .28 # extreme threshold
print(nasmaxthreshold)
sum(vgs$NA_Sales>nasmaxthreshold, na.rm = TRUE) # number of observations above the max threshold
ggplot(data = vgs, aes(y = NA_Sales)) + geom_boxplot() + coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 1.12))
```



### Analysis 2: One Categorical Variable
#### Analyst:Daniel Gurwah

When first looking at this variable, there were some rows where the genre was "". First, I replaced these rows with NA. However, this led to me realizing that these rows also were rows that had no game name. 
When looking at the frequency table it's obvious that action games were clearly the highest games sold and played. They take up just over 20% of the data points. However, after plotting this variable I realized that sports games were also larger than most. The other game genres are about all within 1000 range of each other. 


```{r}
vgs$Genre[vgs$Genre %in% c("")]<- NA
freq_genre <- table(vgs$Genre)
rel_freq_genre <- table(vgs$Genre)/nrow(vgs)
ggplot(data = vgs) + geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = Genre))
```




### Analysis 3: Two Categorical Variables
#### Analyst:[Joey Difrancesco]

[Put text of analysis here and add as many code chunks and text sections as you need.]

```{r}
twoway <- addmargins(table(vgs$Rating, vgs$Genre))
twoway
ggplot(vgs, aes(fill=Rating, y='Rating', x=Genre)) + geom_bar(position= 'stack', stat='identity') + ylab('Count') + xlab('Genre') + theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle = -90, vjust = 0.5))
```




### Analysis 4: One Categorical and One Quantitative Variable
#### Analyst:[Christopher Aguila]

This analysis of one relationship between a categorical variable and a
quantitative variable involves video game genres and the North American sales of
video games. I would hypothesize a potential association between video game
genre (categorical variable) and North American sales (quantitative variable)
because some genres are more frequently bought or are found to be more popular
than other genres. I hypothesize that this would translate into varying sales with
the most frequent genres having more sales than the rest. Based on the frequency
table and the side by side box plot, there does appear to be an association.
The most frequent genre of video games include Action (3370) and sports(2348).
On the side by side box plot, the 3rd quartile for both genres stretches much
farther than the rest, having high max sale values. 


```{r}
summary(vgs$NA_Sales) #summary statistics of North American sales
table(vgs$Genre) #Frequency table of Video Game Genres
nasalesiqr <- IQR(vgs$NA_Sales, na.rm = TRUE) #Calculating the IQR of NA_Sales
highoutlier <- 0.340+(1.5*nasalesiqr) #High outlier formula
boxplot(vgs$NA_Sales~vgs$Genre, main = "North American Sales By Genre", xlab =
          "Genre", ylab = "North American Sales", ylim = c(0,0.8))
```




### Analysis 5: Two Quantitative Variable
#### Analyst:Samson Joseph

For this analysis the variables Critic_Score and NA_Sales were chosen. The explanatory variable would be Critic_Score and the response variable would be NA_Sales.As depicted by the graph below, there is a positive association between the two variables. As Critic_Score goes higher, so does NA_Sales. This makes sense as the more positive reviews from critics, the more the game will sell. Critic scores and reviews gives insight to how potential users might experience the game. They influence potential users, and that is clear based on the graph below. An outlier that was removed was Wii Sports. It is difficult to say if it's sales was related to critic score based on the data we have. It was sold with the Wii console, so it's sales numbers are not necessarily influenced by critics.

```{r warning= FALSE}
ggplot(vgs, aes(Critic_Score, NA_Sales)) + geom_point() +ylab('NA Sales') + xlab('Critic Score') + ylim(0, 20)

```
